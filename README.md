# JÃ¶rn Zaefferer's Standards Tracker

This repository is intended as a public issue tracker for any standards issues I'm involved in. Issues are likely to involve the W3C, WHATWG or browser vendors, since those are mostly relevant for the standards issues I care about.

I may put code into this repository if I'm putting together a polyfill or even a reference implementation.

I'm putting this public mostly so people can give input to the ideas and work-in-progress I'm about to put there.
